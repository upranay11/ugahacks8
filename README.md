Our project is a destination weather site where the user can input a zip code or city and state in order to determine the weather at that location.
This is related to travel/adventure as it helps people determine the weather of the location they are going to and plan for their trip.

Run the index.html file with a browser to open the program.
\nInput a zip code OR input a city's name and select a state.
\nPress enter/submit and receive the weather data of that location.
